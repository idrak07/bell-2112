            <strong>Operation:</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            The hot section of the engine comprises of components downstream of the gas
            generator. Hot expanding gases leaving the combustion chamber are directed
            towards the compressor turbine vane ring and hit the compressor turbine
            blades. The energy extracted by the compressor turbine will drive the
            compressor and the Accessory
         </p>
         <p>
            Gearbox. Thereafter, gases travel across the power turbine vane ring and
            hit the power turbine blades. The power turbine rotation is transmitted to
            the output shaft via the power turbine shaft and the reduction gearbox.
            Gases leaving the power turbine are expelled to the atmosphere through the
            exhaust duct.

            <strong>COMBUSTION CHAMBER LINER</strong>

            <strong>Purpose:</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            Provide an area for combustion of the fuel/air mixture. The reverse flow
            feature provides for a shorter and lighter engine.
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Construction:</strong>

               On PT6T-3D’s power section, the small exit duct is an integral part of
               the liner and it is covered with ceramic coating as thermal barrier.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            <strong>Operation:</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
            P3 air enters the combustion chamber through holes in the inner and outer
            liner walls. The shape, size and location of these holes provide the
            correct fuel/air ratio for all operating conditions. The combustion chamber
            combined with the large and small exit ducts form an envelope that turns
            the gas 180° (reverse flow). This configuration permits location of the
            turbines closer to the compressor and within the combustion chamber area,
            thus making the engine shorter and lighter. Cooling rings direct P3 air
            into the combustion chamber, close to the walls, to form a flame barrier.
